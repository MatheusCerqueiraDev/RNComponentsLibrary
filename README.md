# Expo Component Library with Storybook

This is a component library built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and Storybook, providing reusable UI components for your React Native applications.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start Storybook

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This will launch the Storybook interface where you can browse, test, and interact with all available components. You can view the components in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (with some limitations)

## Component Library Structure

The components are organized in the **app** directory, with each component having its own documentation and usage examples. The library uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for easy navigation.

## Using Components in Your Project

To use these components in your own project:

1. Install this package as a dependency
2. Import components as needed:

```javascript
import { Button, Card, TextField } from "your-component-library";
```
